    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir the yeast into the warm water and let it stand until it turns creamy for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Stir the remaining water into the creamy yeast mixture, and then stir it in the flour, honey and<br>
            salt, one cup at a time. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon for 3 to 4 minutes. Beat with the<br>
            paddle until it forms a sticky dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the biga to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a plastic wrap, and let it rest at room<br>
            temperature for 24 hours, until the starter is triple its original volume.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and refrigerate the biga dough until it is ready to use. Let it rest at a room temperature<br>
            for about 3 hours until it is bubbly and active again. Scoop out the desired amount of biga for<br>
            your recipe and proceed.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Pizza Assemble:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Pizza oven to 280 degrees. Roll and stretch the dough to a 12-inch round, while creating<br>
            a rim along the edge of the dough.</li>
        <li>Brush olive oil over the edges of pizza, then evenly spread about 2/3 cup of the pizza sauce over pizza<br>
            (leaving rim uncoated).</li>
        <li>Top evenly with cheese and pepperoni slices; bake 12 - 15 minutes until crust is golden. Remove from oven,<br>
            cut it into slices.</li>
    </ol>
